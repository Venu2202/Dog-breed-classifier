# Dog Breed Classification

## Project Overview
This Dog Breed Classification project leverages a machine learning model to classify images of dogs into their respective breeds. The Flask app provides a user-friendly web interface to upload dog images and receive breed predictions in real-time.

## Features
- **Flask Web Application:** Allows users to upload dog images and get breed predictions directly from the web interface.
- **Model Training:** Scripts to train the model using a comprehensive dataset.
- **Real-time Predictions:** Classify images and display results dynamically through the Flask app.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- HTML/CSS for the web interface
- JavaScript (optional for interactive elements)

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development, testing, and usage.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed and can install packages using pip. Here's how to install the necessary Python packages:
pip install flask tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib
Installation
Here are the steps to set up your development environment:

Clone the GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/venu2202/dog-breed-classifier.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd dog-breed-classifier
Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Flask App
To run the Flask application locally:
python app.py
This will start the Flask server, typically hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000 where you can access the web interface to upload dog images and receive breed predictions.
